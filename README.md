# Deep_Learning_Practice
Collection of notebooks practicing deep learning, based on Coursera projects

The purpose of this repository is to save Jupyter Notebooks containing mini deep learning projects created as a result of online courses to improve my deep learning skillset.  Below is a list of the notebooks and a brief description.

1. Coursea_Getting_Started_with_TensorFlow_Capstone_Project.ipynb - This project is from the Coursera course 'Getting Started with TensorFlow' where the final project was to develop a deep learning model to classify images of numbers on the sides of buildings indicating the street number.  I used a variety of high-level methods to develop basic MLP and CNN architectures.  This is a simple mini project just to reinforce my understand of the Keras/TensorFlow API so that I am comfortable with building different layers, callbacks, regularizers, saving/loading, visualizations, data manipulation, etc.
