# Deep_Learning_Practice
Collection of notebooks practicing deep learning, based on Coursera notes and projects

The purpose of this repository is to save Jupyter Notebooks containing notes and mini deep learning projects created as a result of online courses to improve my deep learning skillset.  Below is a list of the notebooks and a brief description.

1. Coursea_Getting_Started_with_TensorFlow_Capstone_Project.ipynb

This project is from the Coursera course 'Getting Started with TensorFlow' where the final project was to develop a deep learning model to classify images of numbers on the sides of buildings indicating the street number.  I used a variety of high-level methods to develop basic MLP and CNN architectures.  This is a simple mini project just to reinforce my understand of the Keras/TensorFlow API so that I am comfortable with building different layers, callbacks, regularizers, saving/loading, visualizations, data manipulation, etc.

2. Getting_Started_with_TensorFlow_Week_2.ipynb

Very brief introduction to creating a basic deep learning model

3. Getting_Started_with_TensorFlow_Week_3.ipynb

Introduction to callbacks

4. Getting_Started_with_TensorFlow_Week_4.ipynb

Full process of developing a CNN to classify images. Also includes an introduction to loading pre-trained models

5. Customizing_Your_Model_with_TensorFlow_Week_1.ipynb

Introduction to the Functional API and tensors, variables, and constants in TensorFlow

6. Customizing_Your_Model_with_TensorFlow_Week_2.ipynb

Introduction to data pipeline, including dataset generators and the tf.data module

7. Customizing_Your_Model_with_TensorFlow_Week_3.ipynb

Introduction to model/layer subclassing and custom training loops
